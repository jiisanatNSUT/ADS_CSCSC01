# ADS_CSCSC01

### Lab 1 (Stack):
Problems: 
1. Implement Two Stacks in a Single Array. [link](https://github.com/jiisanatNSUT/ADS_CSCSC01/blob/main/stack/two_stack_in_array.py)
2. Implement n stacks in an Array. [link](https://github.com/jiisanatNSUT/ADS_CSCSC01/blob/main/stack/n_stack_in_array.py)
3. Write the code for the Maze problems. Show the input and output in the Graphical Form. Also show the intermediate stages in the output so that the working of the algorithm is clear. [link](https://github.com/jiisanatNSUT/ADS_CSCSC01/blob/main/stack/maze.py)

Class Problem:
1. Implement: Searching in a 2D matix for a word, if present return the position of each letter.
